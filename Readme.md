### ARDVARK
ArdVark is a desktop application which uses packet sniffing capabilities to monitor network activity. The tool is intended for the purely ethical usage of personal network bandwidth monitoring. ArdVark will inspect packet data to inform a user how much data has been downloaded/uploaded over time. Additional features such as notifying users of weekly usage and predicting peak usage times may also be implemented. 


Run the executable as adminstrator, in order to monitor packet activity.
